Yea I wonder if,
My name has ever crossed ur mind
Even for a second
Know it's been a second
Since we last talked
Or faced each other eye to eye
Know it's been hectic
Ya I should a said this
It kinda hurts cuz it's insane
Yea we walk by and it's like
I don't even know you
Like I've never met you
I see your pictures on my phone
And question why we didn't try 
But we were just habits
Thought we'd always have it
So to my ex bestfriend
I thought I'd know till the end
Sorry I know things aren't going
As we planned
To my once ride or die
The one who always knew me right
We would swear it'd always end up
You and I ❤️
We really messed up this time
We really messed up this time
What about all the nights
Where we'd talk about our lives 
We were just wishing
Wish I would of listened
It kinda hurts cuz it's insane
Yea we walk by and it's like
I don't even know you
Like I've never met you
I see your pictures on my phone
And question why we didn't try 
But we were just habits
Thought we'd always have it
So to my ex bestfriend
I thought I'd know till the end
Sorry I know things aren't going
As we planned
To my once ride or die
The one who always knew me right
We would swear it'd always end up
You and I ❤️
